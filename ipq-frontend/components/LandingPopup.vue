          Hi, welcome to the preview version of the Intro to Psychology Quiz. I
          hope you find it useful!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use the left-right arrows (or A and D keys) to navigate through
            questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The right arrow works as a "Skip" button if you don't know the
            answer. You only get 3 skips, but you might earn more by doing well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flag questions that seem incorrect so they can be reviewed by an LLM
            or me.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can upvote/downvote questions to improve question quality for
            everyone.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Top menu:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can filter questions by chapters or by source.</li>
          <li>
            There is an About page, where you can find more info and how to
            contact me if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dark mode is under construction, but you can try it in the top
            menu!
          </li>
          <li>
            You can toggle the stats/info sidebars by clicking the icons on the
            sides.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Some of the questions might be incorrect, please flag them if you
          think so. This is currently not an official part of the TU/e course,
          just a passion project. I am not responsible for any mistakes or
          inaccuracies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the app is in a preview state, there might be some issues. If you
          find any, please let me know.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Other notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The app currently doesn't work on mobile and doesn't have a
            colorblind mode (please get in touch if you need it).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="notice">
          I use üç™ to remember if you have seen this, and won't show it to you
          again. You can always find it in the top menu.
        </p>
        <v-btn color="primary" @click="closeDialog">I agree</v-btn>
