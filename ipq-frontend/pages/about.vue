        <h2>F.A.Q.:</h2>
        <p><strong>What exactly is this and why does it exist?</strong></p>
        <p>I wanted to create a resource for fellow P&T students after seeing the prev years' students submitted questions. The idea was great, but sometimes there were mistakes in the questions, or they were not really good.
            Having a platform with a voting system and verified questions (at least by an LLM) seemed like a nice idea! I hope you find it useful. The quiz is just because it's fun :)
        </p>

        <p><strong>But why did you really do it?</strong></p>
        <p>Ok, I needed something to keep my mind off Calculus.</p>

        <p><strong>Why ugly?</strong></p>
        <p>I used to do programming, but not web design. Sorry about that!</p>

        <p><strong>Why does this look like it was mostly written by ChatGPT?</strong></p>
        <p>Because... it was</p>

        <p><strong>Can I upload my questions?</strong></p>
        <p>Unfortunately not at this time, because of a potential interference with the current course format.</p>

        <p><strong>What did it cost to make the app, how did you pay for the hosting?</strong></p>
        <p> Nothing so far! Thanks to Vuetify, the generous Firebase free tier and the GitHub Student Pack. Check them out!
            I only pay for the OpenAI tokens, but with new GPT-4o mini, costs are practically nonexistent. If you like the project and want to attempt something similar yourself, feel free to ask! </p>
        
        <p><strong>How can I contact you?</strong></p>
        <p>For any questions or suggestions, hit me up at jakubwerner1@gmail.com or WhatsApp. I have already implemented some of your suggestions, thanks for that! Especially Tim, Suri, Eme and others.</p>
        <p>Special thanks to DaniÃ«l Lakens for endorsing the idea</p>
